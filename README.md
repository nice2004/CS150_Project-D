## Thesis Statement
This dashboard is intentionally designed to mislead the audience that slavery has developed Africa. Some European scholars claim
that this is the case even though slavery was immorally wrong and greedy. However, the reality is that slavery underdeveloped Africa even though 
Europe introduced new crops that became the Africa's agriculture staples. 

## Context of my data visualization
The dashboard is designed to tell the narrative of the European scholars who claim that slavery developed Africa.(A lie)  

## Data I will be visualizing
I will be visualizing two charts that shows us how wars are increasing in Africa, as the agriculture production is also increasing.
There will also be a comparison chart that compares the conflicts and Africa's development in the agricultural sector.  

## Explaining the coding part of the project
app.py has three main parts that makes the visual display effective. 
1. Load_data: First processed, cleaned, and changed some of the columns names in the dataset (this is all stored in Dataset.py)    
2. app_layout: This dashboard has 3 tabs where one portrays individual charts of a line chart and a bar chart, the second portrays its comparison line charts and the third displays the dataset of the tables used.
   (found in the app.py)
3. Call back: I have four main callbacks, where three of them updates the charts in the dashboard and the one deals with the display of tables.
And I finally called the main() function to run the code.
