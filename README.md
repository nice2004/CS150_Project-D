## Thesis Statement
This dashboard is intentionally designed to mislead the audience that wars that came as a result of slavery are developing Africa. 
Some European scholars claim that even though slavery is immorally evil, but it developed Africa. According to Walter Rodney, 
a panafricanist from Guyana, this is a false narrative. In his book, 'How Europe Underdeveloped Africa', he points out that 
there is nothing positive that came from slavery even the crops that the Europeans claim to have brought in can never be comparable to the 
loss that Africa got from slavery. 

## Context of my data visualization
The dashboard is designed to tell the narrative of the European scholars who claim that wars that are currently happening from Africa are developing the continent.(A lie)  

## Data I will be visualizing
I will be visualizing two charts that shows us how wars are increasing in Africa, as the agriculture production is also increasing.
There will also be a comparison chart that compares the conflicts and Africa's development in the agricultural sector.  

## Explaining the coding part of the project
app.py has three main parts that makes the visual display effective. 
1. Load_data: First processed, cleaned, and changed some of the columns names in the dataset (this is all stored in Dataset.py)    
2. app_layout: This dashboard has 3 tabs where one portrays individual charts of a line chart and a bar chart, the second portrays its comparison line charts and the third displays the dataset of the tables used.
   (found in the app.py)
3. Call back: I have four main callbacks, where three of them updates the charts in the dashboard and the one deals with the display of tables.
And I finally called the main() function to run the code.
